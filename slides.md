# Business Chatbot Project
## A Smart Data-Driven Chat Interface

---

## Project Overview

Our chatbot is designed to provide accurate, context-specific information by:

- Answering queries based **only** on provided data
- Processing user-provided documents (CSV, PDF, TXT)
- Building searchable context using document embeddings
- Declining to answer out-of-scope questions

---

## Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query + React Context
- **UI Components**: ShadcnUI library for consistent design
- **Backend Integration**: Flask + LangChain
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for document embeddings
- **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini API

## Key Features

1. **Document Processing**
   - CSV product data processing
   - PDF/TXT parsing for privacy policy and terms
   - Multi-language support including Arabic

2. **Smart Context Management**
   - Conversation history tracking
   - Contextual responses based on previous messages
   - Stays within the boundaries of uploaded data

## User Experience Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - API key configuration
   - Document uploading (CSV, Privacy Policy, Terms)
   - Status indicators for completion

2. **Chat Interface**
   - Welcome screen with introduction
   - Message bubbles with user/bot distinction
   - Quick reply suggestions

## Design Decisions

### 1. Separation of Setup and Chat

- Created dedicated setup page for easier onboarding
- Improves first-time user experience
- Provides clear next steps during configuration

### 2. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Fluid layout adjusts to different screen sizes
- Optimized reading experience on all devices

## Design Decisions (cont.)

### 3. Visual Feedback

- Loading indicators during processing
- Clear success/error states
- Status tracking for required components

### 4. File Management

- Support for multiple file types
- Validation and error handling
- Progress indicators during upload

## Security Considerations

- Client-side API key storage
- No sensitive data stored in state between sessions
- Backend validation of requests
- Rate limiting and error handling

---

## Development Challenges

- Context window limitations with LLMs
- Document chunking strategies
- Balancing performance and accuracy
- Cross-browser compatibility

---

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced document semantic search
- File management (deletion, updates)
- Multiple conversation threads
- Analytics dashboard
- Multi-user support
